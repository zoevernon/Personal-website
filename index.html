<p>Hi, I'm Zoe Vernon.  I am a second year PhD student in the Statistics Department at University of California, Berkeley. Before coming to Berkeley I received by B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis (after transferring from Winthrop University where I also studied Mathematics).<p> 

<p>At UC-Berkeley I am advised by Haiyan Huang.  Currently we are working on developing a new method for analyzing genomic data. <p> 


<p>I am also interested in using statistics to understand sports (particularly basketball) and will hopefully be using my blog to explore that in the future.  <p>

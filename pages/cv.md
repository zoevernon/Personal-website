Education
------
**Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics**, Washington University in St. Louis, Graduated May 2017
**(Current) Ph.D in Statistics**, University of California, Berkeley, May 2022 (expected)

Research
------
Aug. 2017 - Present: **Graduate Student Researcher**, Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley
  * Advised by Professor Haiyan Huang and co-advised by Professor Peter Bickel.
  * Developing methods to address issues that arise in analyzing genomic and biomedical data. 
  * Developed a robust count-based statistic to measure negative dependency between gene expression profiles to assist in drug discovery.
  * Working to extend the semi-supervised learning technique, Gene-Fishing, to be applicable to single cell RNA sequence data.
  * Analyzing MRI and genomic data from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to improve clinical experience.  

Summer 2019: **Intern at Genentech** 
  * Implemented predictive models of cancer patient survival for various levels of data aggregation using random forest and penalized regression.
  
Summer 2016: **Participant in Summer Institute in Biostatistics, North Carolina State University**
